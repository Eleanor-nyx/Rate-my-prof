#Welcome to my project 

##Rate My Professor Application


### *Application Purpose*

- To help students track responses of other *students' experiences* with different professors in lectures, seminars, labs
, etc.
- To help students choose professors according to their *teaching style/teaching direction* of the course content.

### *Target User*

- Any student that is happy with sharing their experience with different professors.
- Any student that want to record professors' characteristics for future choices on courses.

### Why Rate My Prof?

As a student, it is important that we can have enough information to choose our preferable professors' classes. For 
example, some students prefer professors that having fast pace and more in-depth contents; some students prefer 
professors that teaching more detailed and with more patience. With this *Rate My Professor* application, students can 
have better learning experience.

##Phase4 : Task 3
- Very long classes are always confusing, I found that my ListOfRating class is having too many functions. Although I 
  don't have a specific idea on how to modify this class, I believe it will be better if I make that class shorter.
- I want to mention that it was a pity that I was not able to have the SaveReminderWindow. This window can remind you 
  to save to file whenever you want to quit the application. In that case, you will not be able to lost your work in the app. 
  But unfortunately I can't have that window successfully running in this application.
